Name: How to enable multiple executing threads on the same executor

By default the executors only run one thread at any given time. If you are running the Executor on a machine with multiple CPUs it might be worth having multiple executing threads on the Executor.

To enable multiple executing threads edit the NumberOfExecutors setting in the config file and restart the Executor.

Once multiple threads are running these will register themselves as separate Executors. In the Console you will see multiple Executors with the same name.

Each thread will run on a separate port. In the executor settings there is only room to specify one port so all other executors will run on consecutive ports so make sure they are not taken. If you specify port 9001 and you have 3 ports then ports 9001, 9002 and 9003 will be used.
