Name: How to run the Alchemi Manager on MSDE.

MSDE installs only with Windows Security enabled. Alchemi needs SQL Security in order to connect to the database. MSDE should be installed in Mixed authentication mode for Alchemi to be able to connect to it.

To install MSDE in Mixed authentication mode add the following parameter to the setup:
SECURITYMODE=SQL

Example:
Setup.exe SECURITYMODE=SQL SAPWD=pwd
