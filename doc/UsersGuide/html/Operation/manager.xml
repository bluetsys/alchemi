  Under service-mode operation, the GUI shown in fig. 3 is used to start / stop the Manager service. The service will continue to operate even after the service controller application exits.
</p>

<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>
  The manager logs its output and errors to a log file called “alchemi-manager.log”. This can be used to debug the manager / report errors / verify the manager operation. The log file is placed in the “dat” directory under the installation directory.
