<h2>Executor Configuration</h2>

<p>
  The Executor is configured from the application itself.
</p>
<p>
You need to configure 2 aspects of the Executor:
<ul>
  <li>
    The host and port of the Manager to connect to.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dedicated / non-dedicated execution. A non-dedicated Executor executes grid threads on a voluntary basis (it requests threads to execute from the Manager), while a dedicated Executor is always executing grid threads (it is directly provided grid threads to execute by the Manager). A non-dedicated Executor works behind firewalls.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
