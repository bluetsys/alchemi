  The Network is the Computer

<p>
  The idea of meta-computing - the use of a network of many independent computers
  as if they were one large parallel machine, or virtual supercomputer - is very compelling
  since it enables supercomputer-scale processing power to be had at a fraction of
  the cost of traditional supercomputers.

  While traditional virtual machines (e.g. clusters) have been designed for a small
  number of tightly coupled homogeneous resources, the exponential growth in Internet
  connectivity allows this concept to be applied on a much larger scale. This, coupled
  with the fact that desktop PCs in corporate and home environments are heavily underutilized
  – typically only one-tenth of processing power is used – has given rise to interest
  in harnessing the vast amounts of processing power that is available in the form
  of spare CPU cycles on Internet- or intranet-connected desktops. This new paradigm
  has been dubbed Grid Computing.

<p>
  Popular distributed computing projects that proved the feasibility of the concept
  are distributed.net and Seti @ Home.
