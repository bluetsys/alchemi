<h2>
  How Alchemi Works
</h2>
<p>
  There are four types of distributed components (nodes) involved in the construction of Alchemi
  grids and execution of grid applications: Manager, Executor, User & Cross-Platform Manager.

<p>
  A grid is created by installing Executors on each machine that is to be part of the grid and
  linking them to a central Manager component. The Windows installer setup that comes with the
  Alchemi distribution and minimal configuration makes it very easy to set up a grid.
</p>
<p>
  An Executor can be configured to be dedicated (meaning the Manager initiates thread execution
  directly) or non-dedicated (meaning that thread execution is initiated by the Executor.)
  Non-dedicated Executors can work through firewalls and NAT servers since there is only
  one-way communication between the Executor and Manager. Dedicated Executors are more suited
  to an intranet environment and non-dedicated Executors are more suited to the Internet environment.
</p>
<p>
  Users can develop, execute and monitor grid applications using the .NET API and tools which
  are part of the Alchemi SDK. Alchemi offers a powerful grid thread programming model which
  makes it very easy to develop grid applications and a grid job model for grid-enabling
  legacy or non-.NET applications.
</p>
<p>
  An optional component (not shown) is the Cross Platform Manager web service which offers
  interoperability with custom non-.NET grid middleware.
