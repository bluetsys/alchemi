JobAPI Example
==============

This example demonstrates submitting jobs via the Alchemi API.

.\Reverse contains a console application project whose output is Reverse.exe. Reverse.exe reverses the contents of a text file supplied as a command line parameter and displays the result on the console.

.\GridReverser contains the actual example. It shows how to grid-enable Reverse.exe by creating a task containing multiple jobs.
