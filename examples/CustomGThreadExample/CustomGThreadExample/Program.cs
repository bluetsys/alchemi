    /// The program reads an input file block by block and passes the string data
    /// to grid threads. The grid application is then run, and the output from each
    /// thread is added to an array.  When the application has finished, the output in
    /// the array is combined and written to disk.
    /// 
    /// With minor modifications, this example can be adapted for any task that allows for
    /// parallel processing of an input file separated into blocks that can be later
    /// recombined to an output file.
    /// 
    /// E.g., increasing or decreasing the volume of a WAV file, or encoding WAV to MP3.
